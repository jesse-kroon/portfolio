<h1 class="mb-10 text-3xl text-white">Hi, I'm Jesse!</h1>
<p class="text-lg text-white">
	I currently work as a Software Development teacher in Heerlen, the Netherlands. In my free time, I
	enjoy creating (mostly web) applications and studying front-end web development. Before becoming
	an educator, I worked as a full-stack software engineer in the automotive industry, using Go on
	the backend and React + TypeScript on the frontend.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-white">
	As a personal project, I’ve finally decided to create a portfolio website where I can share some
	of the projects I create in my free time, as well as bite-sized frontend components I’m building
	through <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.com" class="text-yellow-300 hover:text-green-400"
		>Frontend Mentor</a
	>.
</p>

<p class="text-lg text-white">
	In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, playing a variety of games—
	from video games to trading card and board games—while also expanding my knowledge in different
	fields.
