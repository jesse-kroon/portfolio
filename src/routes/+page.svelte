<h1 class="mb-10 text-2xl text-white">Hi, I'm Jesse!</h1>
<p class="text-white">
	I am currently working as a Software Development teacher in Heerlen, The Netherlands. In my free
	time I enjoy creating (mostly web) applications and studying front-end web development. Before
	becoming an educator I have worked as a fullstack software engineer in the automotive industry
	using Go in the backend, and React + TypeScript in the frontend.

<p class="text-white">
	As a personal project I have finally decided to create a portfolio website on which I can share
	some of the projects I create in my free time as well as bite-sized frontend components I am
	making through <a
		href="https://www.frontendmentor.com"
		class="text-yellow-300 hover:text-green-400">Frontend Mentor</a
	>.
</p>

<p class="text-white">
	In my spare-time enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, playing games ranging from video
	games to Trading Card Games and board games and gaining knowledge in various fields.
